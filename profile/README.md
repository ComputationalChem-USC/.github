## 👋 About Us

We are the **Theoretical and Computational Chemistry (QTEC)** research group at the [University of Santiago de Compostela (USC)](https://www.usc.es), Spain. Our work sits at the intersection of **physical chemistry**, **quantum mechanics**, and **computational methods** to understand chemical reactivity, molecular structure, and dynamics at a fundamental level.

🌐 **Website:** [computchem.gal](https://computchem.gal)

## 🔬 Research Lines

Our group develops and applies cutting-edge theoretical and computational tools across several interconnected research areas:

- ⚗️ **Chemical Kinetics** — Integrated computational protocols for accurate rate constant calculations, including tunneling and variational effects.
- 🤖 **AutoMeKin** — Automated method for reaction mechanism discovery using molecular dynamics and graph theory.
- 🔗 **Noncovalent Interactions** — Functional Group Corrections (FGC) approach for semiempirical quantum mechanical methods.
- 🌌 **Intermolecular Potential Energy Surfaces** — Accurate evaluation of PES for van der Waals complexes and clusters.
- 🌀 **ECD Spectra** — Computational evaluation of Electron Circular Dichroism spectra in poly(phenylacetylene)s.
- 🧠 **Machine Learning for Chemistry** — Applying ML approaches to the study and prediction of chemical reactions, including reaction path exploration, potential energy surface fitting, and reactivity prediction.
